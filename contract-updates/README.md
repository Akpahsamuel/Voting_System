# Improved Authentication Model for Voting App

## Overview of Changes

The voting system has been updated with an improved authorization model that focuses on **address-based registration** rather than tracking individual capability IDs. This change improves both security and usability.

### Key Improvements

1. **Address-based Authorization**: The system now checks if an address is registered in the admin/superadmin registry instead of tracking individual capability IDs.

2. **Simplified Revocation**: Revoking admin/superadmin access only requires the address, not the capability ID.

3. **No More "Capability ID Required" Errors**: Users won't see confusing errors requesting capability IDs.

4. **Cleaner UI**: Form fields for capability IDs have been removed.

## Contract Changes

The main changes to the contract include:

1. **Removed revoked capability tracking**:
   - Removed `revoked_admin_caps` and `revoked_super_admin_caps` VecSets
   - Added contextual authorization checks using `tx_context::sender(ctx)`

2. **Simplified revocation functions**:
   - `revoke_admin` now only requires the address to revoke
   - `revoke_super_admin` now only requires the address to revoke

3. **Better authorization errors**:
   - Added new error codes specifically for unauthorized admin/superadmin actions
   - Updated assertions to check sender address against the registry

## Frontend Changes

The frontend has been updated to:

1. **Remove capability ID fields** from revocation forms
2. **Update transaction calls** to only pass necessary arguments
3. **Update UI and explanations** to reflect the new authorization model
4. **Add helpful explanations** about the address-based registry system

## How to Deploy

1. **Update the Contract**:
   ```bash
   # Publish the updated contract
   sui client publish --gas-budget 20000000 --json
   ```

2. **Update the Frontend**:
   - Replace `SuperAdminManagement.tsx` with the updated file
   - Ensure all imports are correctly resolved
   - Add an informational notice to users about the authorization model change

## Testing Guidelines

1. **Test Admin Granting**:
   - Grant admin privileges to a new address
   - Verify the address receives an AdminCap
   - Verify the address is added to the admin registry

2. **Test Admin Revocation**:
   - Revoke admin privileges from an address
   - Verify the address is removed from the admin registry
   - Verify the address can no longer perform admin actions

3. **Test SuperAdmin Granting and Revocation**:
   - Follow similar steps as above for superadmin privileges

## Compatibility Notes

The updated contract maintains backward compatibility with existing capabilities, but the authorization model has fundamentally changed:

- Existing AdminCap/SuperAdminCap objects will continue to work as long as the address is in the registry
- The system no longer cares which specific capability object is used, only that the caller's address is authorized
